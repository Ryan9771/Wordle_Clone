## Wordle_Clone
A clone of the viral 'wordle' game, using JFrame, and swing.

## How to play
- Clone the repository, and compile the files in `src/` 
- Run `Main.java`, and a JFrame window with the wordle game will pop up.

## Extra Features
- To **modify** the set of words used in the game, feel free to *add* or *remove* words to the `words` array in `Words.java`
- Unlike the actual wordle, this version does not prevent non-dictionary words from being entered. So feel free to enter any combination of letters to decipher the winning word.
- The game also lets the player know the **winning** word if the player loses or wins. This way, you will not be scratching your head if you lost the game.
